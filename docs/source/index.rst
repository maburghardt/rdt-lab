ComplianceAsCode/content
========================

As a complement for better understanding of how the ComplianceAsCode project interacts
with the many components spread among the root folders, you can take advantage of these
flowcharts.

They were written to be interpreted by the `mermaid JavaScript library <https://mermaid-js.github.io/>`_,
so they can be easily ported, updated or modified locally or even `online <https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid-live-editor/>`_.

.. note::
   TIP
   You can play with these individual flowcharts combining them in a bigger unified flowchart where you
   can create more complex relationships from different perspectives.
