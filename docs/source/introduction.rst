Introduction
============

As a complement for better understanding of how the ComplianceAsCode project interacts
with the many components spread among the root folders, you can take advantage of these
flowcharts.

They were written to be interpreted by the `mermaid JavaScript library <https://mermaid-js.github.io/>`_,
so they can be easily ported, updated or modified locally or even `online <https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid-live-editor/>`_.

.. tip::
   You can play with these individual flowcharts combining them in a bigger unified
   flowchart where you can create more complex relationships from different perspectives.

.. note::
   These flowcharts are not automatically updated. While the overall project structure is
   not expected to undergo major changes frequently, it is possible that the flowcharts
   do not reflect the most up-to-date structure.

   It is intended to automate the maintenance of these flowcharts at some level. However,
   to achieve this, we first need to assess the means to simplify the structure, and
   these flowcharts are the beginning of those assessments.
